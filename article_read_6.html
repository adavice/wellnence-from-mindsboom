                    <p>Obesity is a growing epidemic as more people than ever are struggling to control their weight.
                        Larger portion sizes are thought to contribute to overeating and unwanted weight gain. Research
                        shows that many factors can affect how much you eat. People eat almost anything they serve
                        themselves. Therefore, controlling portion sizes can help prevent overeating. Here are 9 tips
                        for measuring and controlling the section sizes - both at home and on the go.</p>
                    <h3>1. USE SMALLER TABLEWARE</h3>
                    <p>There is some evidence that the size of plates, spoons and glasses can unknowingly influence how
                        much food a person eats. For example, using large plates can make food appear smaller, often
                        leading to overeating. In one study, people using a large bowl ate 77% more pasta than those
                        using a medium bowl. In another study, nutritionists served themselves 31% more ice with larger
                        bowls and 14.5% more when provided with larger serving spoons.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, most of the people who ate more because of large dishes were completely unaware of
                        the change in portion size. Therefore, swapping your usual plate, bowl, or serving spoon for a
                        smaller alternative can help cut down on food and prevent overeating. Most people feel just as
                        full from a smaller dish as from a large one.</p>
                    <h3>2. USE YOUR PLATE AS A SERVING GUIDE</h3>
                    <p>If measuring or weighing food isn't appealing, try your plate or bowl as a serving guide. This
                        can help you determine the optimal macronutrient ratio for a balanced meal.</p>
                    <p>A rough guide to any meal is:</p>
                    <p>Vegetables or Salad: Half a plate<br>
                        High-Quality Protein: Quarter of a plate - this includes meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, tofu,
                        beans, and legumes<br>
                        Complex Carbohydrates: Quarter of a plate - such as whole grains and starchy vegetables<br>
                        High-fat foods: Half a tablespoon (7 grams) - including cheese, oils, and butter<br>
                        Remember, this is a rough guide as people have different nutritional needs. For example, those
                        who are more physically active often need more food. Since vegetables and salad are naturally
                        low in calories but high in fiber and other nutrients, filling these up can help you avoid
                        eating too many calories. If you want extra guidance, some manufacturers sell portion control
                        plates.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. USE YOUR HANDS AS A SERVICE GUIDE</h3>
                    <p>Another way to measure the correct portion size without measuring tools is to simply use your
                        hands. Since your hands usually correspond to your body size, taller people who need more food
                        tend to have larger hands. A rough guide to any meal is:</p>
                    <p>Protein-rich foods: One palm-sized serving for women and two palm-sized servings for men - such
                        as meat, fish, poultry, and beans
                        Vegetables and Salads: One fist-sized serving for women and two fist-sized servings for men
                    </p>
                    <p>Carbohydrate-rich foods: One serving for women and two for men - such as whole grains and starchy
                        vegetables
                        High-fat foods: One thumb-sized serving for women and two for men - such as butter, oil, and
                        nuts
                    </p>
                    <h3>4. ASK FOR HALF PORTION IF YOU GO OUT FOR EATING</h3>
                    <p>Restaurants are notorious for serving large portions. In fact, restaurant portion sizes are on
                        average about 2.5 times larger than standard portion sizes - and up to eight times larger. When
                        eating out, you can always ask for half a portion or a child's dish. This will save you a lot of
                        calories and prevent you from overeating. You can also share a meal with someone or order a
                        starter and side dish instead of a main course. Other tips include ordering a salad or
                        vegetables, asking for sauces and dressings to serve separately, and avoiding all-you-can-eat
                        buffet-style restaurants where it is very easy to indulge.</p>
                    <h3>5. START ALL MEALS WITH A GLASS OF WATER</h3>
                    <p>Drinking a glass of water up to 30 minutes before a meal naturally aids portion control.
                        Refilling with water will make you feel less hungry. If you are well hydrated, you can also
                        distinguish between hunger and thirst. A study in middle-aged and older adults found that
                        drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before each meal resulted in a 44% greater weight loss over
                        12 weeks, likely due to reduced food intake. Similarly, overweight and obese older adults
                        consumed 500ml of water 30 minutes before a meal 13% fewer calories without trying to make
                        changes. In another study in young men of normal weight, immediately drinking a similar amount
                        of water before a meal resulted in a greater feeling of fullness and decreased food intake.
                        Therefore, a glass of water before every meal can help prevent overeating and aid portion
                        control.</p>
                    <h3>
                        6. TAKE IT SLOWLY
                    </h3>
                    <p>Eating quickly makes you less aware that you are full - and therefore increases the risk of
                        overeating. Since it can take your brain about 20 minutes to register that you are full after
                        eating, slowing down can reduce your overall intake.</p>
                    <h3>IT COMES DOWN TO</h3>
                    <p>Unwanted weight gain can start with large portion sizes. However, there are many practical steps
                        you can take to serve servings. These simple changes have proven successful in reducing portions
                        without compromising on taste or feelings of fullness. For example, measuring your food, using
                        smaller dishes, drinking water before meals, and eating slowly can reduce the risk of
                        overeating. At the end of the day, portion control is a quick fix that will improve your quality
                        of life and possibly prevent cavities.</p>
