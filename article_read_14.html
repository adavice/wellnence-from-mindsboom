                    <p>For a long time it was considered indisputable that it is simply contraindicated to eat at night,
                        as this causes serious harm to the body and leads to rapid aging.

                    </p>
                    <p> In principle, it is difficult to refuse a full-fledged dinner only if the work schedule does not
                        allow - you come home too late from work. But even here you can contrive. Only is it worth it?
                        And is food at night so harmful?</p>
                    <h3>What are the risks of eating at night?</h3>
                    <p>Hunger in the evening, night, especially during sleep, contributes to the recovery of a person.
                        This process is prevented from starting during the day by food, as well as stress. If we eat
                        late dinner, we do not allow the body to recover.</p>
                    <p>Eating food at night slows down the production of melatonin, which brings about sleep. It turns
                        out that having dinner late, we also fall asleep badly.</p>
                    <p>Evening hunger also contributes to the fact that the body begins to process its own fat, saving
                        glucose. And on the contrary, eating at night can easily add a few extra and most likely
                        unnecessary pounds to you.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, more often than not, we ignore dinner:<br>
                        to feel good;<br>
                        to sleep well;<br>
                        to lose weight, or at least not to gain weight.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Of course, all this should not apply to children who need food before bedtime more than a younger
                        child, and to young people under 23, when the body is still in the stage of development and
                        growth.</p>
                    <p>And if you do not have these three reasons why people refuse dinner, then why not have dinner,
                        would there be a desire?</p>
                    <h3>What is the best to eat for dinner?</h3>
                    <p>If you are not inclined to be overweight, then easily digestible foods with a high glycemic
                        index, eaten for dinner, will even help you fall asleep. You don't just need to consume alcohol
                        and beverages containing caffeine.</p>
                    <p>The glycemic index is a number from one to one hundred that indicates how quickly carbohydrate
                        foods are absorbed. Foods with a high glycemic index, even eaten at night, are beneficial, easy
                        to digest, and do not interfere with falling asleep quickly. It even speeds up the production of
                        serotonin, which contributes to drowsiness. Such foods in the evenings, by stimulating the
                        production of melatonin and serotonin - hormones that induce sleep, relax tense muscles, calm
                        the nerves, and do not strain the stomach.</p>
                    <p>Only people with diabetes or obesity should beware of foods with a high glycemic index. So it is
                        harmful for them to eat at night.
                    </p>
                    <p>Glucose has the highest glycemic index level - 100. The following also have a high level:
                        <li>
                            <ul>pancakes and white bread;</ul>
                            <ul>brown rice;</ul>
                            <ul>baked potatoes or mashed potatoes from boiled potatoes;</ul>
                            <ul>boiled carrots, pumpkin;</ul>
                            <ul>honey, bananas, raisins, kiwi, sweets.</ul>
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>Vegetable dishes with light white wine are also not prohibited.

                        It is useful to drink warm milk at night, which soothes, as well as kefir, infusion of oregano,
                        chamomile tea with honey.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How to control your appetite?</h3>
                    <p>Usually in the evening you are more hungry than during the day. But overeating is by no means
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>1. In the evening, the body rebuilds to accumulate reserves, putting food in the "bins". And a
                        couple of hours after dinner, the desire to eat something again appears. Therefore, in the
                        evening you need to eat several times, but little by little. The first time is to have a snack
                        of yogurt or curd before leaving work. Then, at home, drink chamomile with honey, and after half
                        an hour arrange dinner - pancakes or mashed potatoes with kefir.</p>
                    <p>2. Food should not be monotonous, then each time new flavor combinations will be included, you
                        will eat more slowly, and the feeling of fullness will come faster.</p>
                    <p>3. A glass of warm water, drink 15 minutes before dinner. You can also drink a glass of kefir or
                        weak tea with milk. But not juice - it stimulates the secretion of gastric juice.
                    </p>
                    <p>4. Do not eat treats on an empty stomach, or turn them into an independent meal. You must first
                        get enough of your usual daily food, and at the end of the meal, slowly eat a small amount of
                        the treat. There will be no extra pounds from this risk.
                    </p>
                    <p> 5. The day should be started with a full breakfast, and also do not miss lunch, then you will
                        not want to eat up at night.</p>
                    <p>6. Often in the evenings they eat just out of idleness - then go to put a tea, then have a snack.
                        Eating one thing or the other in the evenings is quite an interesting activity, but it is better
                        to do other interesting and useful things.
                    </p>
                    <p> 7. Keep low-calorie foods and vegetables in a visible place in the refrigerator. Put the rest
                        away, promising yourself that it will definitely be eaten, but only in the morning. And in the
                        morning it will be simply unrealistic to force everyone to eat everything that is hidden in the
                        refrigerator, so there will be something to take with you to work.</p>
                    <p> 8. Aromatherapy - helps to cope with hunger.</p>
                    <p> Cinnamon, mint, green apple and vanilla scents are recommended. Essential oils can not only be
                        applied to the skin, but also inhaled in the following way. We pinch one nostril, and take a
                        strong breath in the other. Then vice versa. Inhaling such smells is very helpful for those who
                        suffer from psychological hunger - this is when the appetite wakes up just from seeing a
                        delicious dish. In this case, inhalation of essential oil will help get rid of the glamor.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can just sniff orange or tangerine peels.
                    </p>
                    <p> 9. Often we mistake an ordinary thirst for hunger. Liquid in the form of green or herbal tea,
                        tomato juice, quickly dulls the feeling of hunger.</p>
                    <p> 10. Immediately after dinner, you need to brush your teeth to trigger a conditioned reflex:
                        after brushing your teeth, you should no longer eat.</p>
