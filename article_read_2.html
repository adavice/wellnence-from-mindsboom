                    </div>
                    <p>Coconut oil, just like a cheeky dude who grew into a full-fledged hunk, is now the hot, sexy oil
                        that no one can shut up about. Gwyneth Paltrow swallows it in her mouth to whiten her teeth,
                        Poppy Delevingne sleeps in it, and Kelly Osborne wants you all to tap your cheekbones for a
                        natural highlight. Coconut oil does not moisturize - not oil - but used strategically, it can
                        soften, add shine and help repair dry hair.
                        Read on for nine ways to use coconut oil in your hair routine.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. USE IT AS A PROTECTIVE "PRE-POO"</h3>
                    <p>Here's a trick that's especially helpful for those with dry or curly hair: avoid scalp, coat dry
                        hair with a dollop of coconut oil an hour or so before taking a shower. The oil protects each
                        strand from drying out while you shampoo. Rinse the oil from your hair after shampooing and
                        apply conditioner as normal. (Note that if you have thin hair, the oil may be too much for you.)
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. MAKE YOUR CONDITION BETTER THAN IT EVER BEEN</h3>
                    <p>Coconut oil makes any conditioner even more conditioning. After you saturate your hair with
                        conditioner, add a layer of coconut oil on top. The oil is occlusive, so it will trap the
                        conditioner's moisturizing ingredients in your hair, allowing them to penetrate the shaft longer
                        and more effectively. Wait at least 15 minutes or up to an hour before rinsing - the longer you
                        wait, the softer your hair will be.</p>
                    <h3>3. JUST LET IT IN
                    </h3>
                    <p>This is a convenient solution for those with thick, dry hair. After your shampoo and conditioner,
                        comb all the moisturizer through your hair (DevaCurls' Supercream and Oyin Handmade's Hair Dew
                        are really great). Then take a quarter amount of coconut oil and put it on top of the
                        moisturizer. Dry your hair as you normally would. The oil traps in the moisturizer and keeps
                        your hair hydrated for longer.</p>
                    <h3>4. MAKE DETANGLING A LITTLE LESS BURNING</h3>
                    <p>Bun hair? Run coconut oil over the sections that need a little help. The oil provides a useful
                        "slip" that makes combing less difficult.</p>
                    <h3>5. AND MAKE YOUR HAIR MORE PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
                    <p>Instead of putting a lot of shiny stuff in your hair, scoop a few dollops of coconut oil into a
                        spray bottle and spritz your hair for a natural shine. If you are working with solidified oil,
                        place the bottle in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes to allow the oil to liquefy again.
                    </p>
                    <h3>6. WEAR IT LIKE A BATH CAP</h3>
                    <p>The worst thing about taking a dip? The big salt and chlorine wreck on your hair, of course.
                        Before going to the pool or beach, cover your hair with coconut oil. The oil acts as a barrier
                        between your strands and the water to some extent. Think of it as a natural swim cap (or a swim
                        cap that won't make you look like a sucker).</p>
                    <h3>7. OR A HUMIDITY DEGREE</h3>
                    <p>Rub a pea-sized amount of coconut oil between your fingers to tame flyaways and frizz. Transfer
                        the oil to the frizzy areas of your hair to soothe rogue strands. A little goes a long way!</p>
                    <!--******* sidebar-->
                    <h3>8. PHOTOSHOP YOUR SPLIT POINTS</h3>
                    <p>Coconut oil doesn't glue your split ends back together (nothing will, despite what some products
                        claim), but it can hide frayed ends for a short while. Simply rub a little bit on your ends. The
                        oil gives shine and temporarily smoothes the torn hair.</p>
                    <h3>9. GET RID OF LICE</h3>
                    <p>Coconut oil is surprisingly effective. A 2002 study looked at 940 children who were given coconut
                        oil, anise oil and ylang hair cocktail. The mixture was applied to each child's hair three times
                        a day for five days. The combination of coconut and oil was successful for 92.3 percent of the
                        lice cases, slightly better than the medicinal control group, which saw a 92.2 percent success
                        rate.</p>
                    <h3>BUT DO NOT USE IT FOR HAIR LOSS OR DANDRUFF.</h3>
                    <p>There are no credible, peer-reviewed studies showing that coconut oil can grow hair. It's a bit
                        boring, but your best bet is still Rogaine. As for dandruff, coconut oil can cause even more
                        flakes! When used on your scalp, coconut oil clogs pores and prevents hair follicles from
                        "breathing". This dries out your scalp and can make a case of dandruff more pronounced. The
                        solution? Try a medicated shampoo. </p>

                        BENEFITS OF COCONUT OIL
                    </h3>
                    <p>Coconut oil is rich in antioxidants and fatty acids and has antiviral, antifungal and
                        antibacterial properties. This allows coconut oil to improve the appearance, texture and health
                        of our hair. When used on hair, coconut oil can:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- improve hair dryness</li>
                        <li>- improve scalp health</li>
                        <li>- protect the hair against protein loss</li>
                        <li>- protect hair from UV exposure</li>
                        <li>- fight infections and fungus</li>
                        <li>- support hair growth</li>
                        <li>- add volume and shine</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Lush, shiny, manageable and healthy hair can be yours - with the benefits of coconut oil! Have
                        you been tempted to ditch your commercial conditioners, serums, and styling products that damage
                        your hair (and possibly your health) over time? Well guess what? You can replace them with this
                        all-natural solution. Coconut oil is rich in antimicrobial properties, lauric acid and medium
                        chain fatty acids that strengthen hair, condition the scalp and help hair regrowth. While we've
                        been hearing about coconut oil's internal health benefits for quite some time, it is time to
                        bring light to other uses of coconut oil, including its use as an all-natural, multitasking hair
                        care product. Rich in vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, the nourishing benefits of coconut
                        oil for hair keeps your hair strong, shiny and looking great!</p>
