                    <p>One of the challenges we can face in adapting to a healthy lifestyle is weighing the cost of our
                        food bill. Sometimes the high-quality food options aren't the cheapest products to purchase and
                        clean eating can be difficult to manage - especially if you're studying or working part-time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>WHAT EXACTLY IS 'CLEAN EATING'?</h3>
                    <p>Clean eating refers to eating minimally processed, nutritious products that have no additives -
                        foods such as fresh vegetables and legumes, whole grains, fruits, and lean meats. Unfortunately,
                        the thing that can often keep us from buying these higher quality foods is cost - good quality
                        healthy products are often more expensive than less healthy alternatives, especially when
                        labeled as 'organic'. However, clean eating on a budget is possible! It just takes a little
                        research, planning ahead, and sticking to your meal plans.</p>
                    <p>Do you want to know how to eat clean without spending all your money? Follow these simple tips to
                        help you eat a healthy diet and stay on track with your budget.</p>
                    <h3>TIP 1. CHOOSE YOUR FOOD STORE WISELY</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever walked into a food store to see the same food you recently bought, for half the
                        price? While this can be very frustrating, there is a way to use it to your advantage. Do some
                        research by checking out nearby farmers' markets, health food stores, small food chains and
                        commercial stores - then compare their prices. You will eventually learn which one offers the
                        best quality and bang for your buck so you can choose to buy food there more often</p>
                    <p>The type of food stores available to you will depend on where you live, but the more research you
                        do before committing to a regular store, the better. Sometimes your most convenient is less
                        budget-friendly than alternatives and can cost you more in the long run.</p>
                    <h3>TIP 2. CHOOSE CHEAPER BRANDS</h3>
                    <p>Generic brands often contain products of the same quality, but can be much cheaper. Remember that
                        more expensive does not always mean better quality! Sometimes the appearance and taste can vary
                        from brand to brand, but for 'clean' food this is often minimal.</p>
                    <h3>TIP 3. INGREDIENTS ARE IMPORTANT!</h3>
                    <p>Look for seasonal fruits and vegetables available in your area - they are likely to be more
                        expensive if sold outside of their natural season. Do you need a prescription for products that
                        are not in season where you live? Try to swap the ingredients for something similar that is in
                        season. Your dish will probably taste better for it too, because the ingredients are at their
                        best!</p>
                    <h3>TIP 4. DON'T BE GIVEN BY "ORGANIC" LABELS</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes a product that appears organic (based on words or images on the packaging) is actually
                        not! Take care when choosing items that appear 'organic' as this term can sometimes be used to
                        make a product appear healthier than its competition, when it is not officially certified as an
                        organic product. In order to be certified as organic, an extensive process actually has to take
                        place where the business is audited by a third party organic certification company.</p>
                    <p>Also, some foods are generally produced with fewer (or no) chemicals, so buying a more expensive
                        "organic" version may not necessarily be worth it. The key is to do some research on how your
                        food is produced and then take this into account while shopping. This way, you can choose
                        organic when you need it, not because the label promotes it that way.</p>
                    <h3>TIP 5. BULK IS THE BEST!</h3>
                    <p>If you know that a food is something you eat often and will last a long time, buy it in bulk. For
                        example, large bottles of healthy oils and grains are good to buy in bulk as you will likely use
                        them a lot when preparing 'clean' food. When you first start to change your diet, it may feel
                        like your food bill is higher than normal. In the first few shopping trips, you buy pantry
                        staples that will last. However, once your pantry is stocked, you'll find that groceries are
                        getting cheaper and you may not have to go as often!</p>
                    <h3>TIP 6. BE SMART WITH YOUR MEAL PREPARATION</h3>
                    <p>After you go to a grocery store, you don't want to have so much food left that it starts to go
                        bad before you can cook it. To avoid this, be prepared before shopping! Make a list of the meals
                        you will eat in the week before you go shopping, noting any social events you have during that
                        week. Then determine which ingredients you need for each meal. If you plan meals according to
                        recipes, consider the number of serves and decide if this is realistic for your week.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to cooking, you can also use all your ingredients and prepare ahead of time. If a
                        recipe says it serves two, use the extra serves as a meal for another day. Sometimes, even if
                        you limit the number of servings in a recipe, you may still have to buy all the food you would
                        like to make the whole lot. Rather than getting wasted, prepping the recipe in full means eating
                        meals for other days and can save you money in the long run!</p>
                    <h3>TIP 7. SAVE WHAT YOU CAN</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes plans change and you realize you don't have a chance to eat all the fruits and
                        vegetables you bought. Spend some time chopping them up, seal them in zippered containers or
                        bags, and keep in the freezer. These can then be used roadside for meals such as smoothies or
                        stir fry.</p>
                    <h3>EATING CLEAN DOES NOT HAVE TO BREAK YOUR BUDGET</h3>
                    <p>Eating clean doesn't have to mean spending all your hard-earned money on the most expensive
                        organic products or superfoods. Sometimes it only takes a few small changes to save you some
                        serious money and stay healthy.</p>
