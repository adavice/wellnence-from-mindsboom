                    </div>
                    <p>Water is essential to life, and maintaining hydration is important for physical and mental
                        performance. The human body is largely made up of water. Body water levels decrease with age,
                        from about 75% in babies to 60% in adults. Although we can live without food for up to 50 days,
                        without water we will survive only a few days, even in a cool climate. People generally drink
                        enough water, but for specific population groups, such as the elderly, or while exercising,
                        fluid intake can become critical.</p>
                    <h3>DAILY WATER LOSS</h3>
                    <p>Water constantly leaves our body through the skin, which is about 700 ml per day. We lose another
                        100 ml through feces, about 1.5 liters as urine and 200 ml with normal perspiration. So even
                        living and breathing in a temperate climate requires about 2.5 liters per day. Exercise and
                        rises in temperature increase perspiration, loss of water and thus moisture requirements. During
                        illness and diarrhea, water losses will also increase significantly.</p>
                    <h3>THE EFFECTS OF DEHYDRATION</h3>
                    <p>Dehydration can cause headaches, fatigue and loss of concentration. It's a problem mostly
                        associated with aging, as older adults are less prone to mild dehydration, drink less, and take
                        longer to rehydrate. A deterioration in mental performance can also occur in slightly dehydrated
                        younger adults. Children lose more water in perspiration when trying to stay cool, so it's
                        important to make sure they drink enough in hot weather.
                        Drink enough to maintain hydration. We need to drink enough to balance water losses. The
                        metabolic processes in our body produce about 250 ml, and we get another 750 ml from our food.
                        This leaves 1.5 liters from drinks. All water-based drinks can contribute to the overall
                        hydration requirement including fruit juice, soft drinks, tea, coffee, diluted alcoholic drinks
                        such as beer, as well as pure water itself. It has been shown that the palatability of drinks is
                        important when the need for moisture is high. Studies have also shown that caffeine in amounts
                        typical of a cup of coffee or tea or a cola drink does not have a drying effect, so experts now
                        agree that regular caffeine beverages can contribute to the overall water requirement. Beverages
                        with 10% alcohol or more, like most wines, do result in net liquid losses.
                    </p>
                    <h3>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE PLAY SPORTS IN WARM CLIMATES?</h3>
                    <p>During exercise, our bodies stay cool by evaporating moisture from our skin like sweat, so we
                        need to drink more to avoid dehydration. In cold or temperate climates, young people can often
                        tolerate a 2% body weight loss as water without compromising physical performance, but in the
                        heat this amount of moisture loss impairs performance and can lead to heat sickness. Losing more
                        than 5% of body weight can decrease the capacity to work by about 30%. A number of studies have
                        shown that maintaining hydration before and during endurance training is effective in improving
                        performance under a variety of conditions.</p>
                    <h3>SALT STIMULATES WATER INTAKE AND HELPS RETAIN DURING AND AFTER SPORTS</h3>
                    <p>Adding sodium (salt) to drinks stimulates the absorption of carbohydrates and this improves the
                        absorption of water. Replacing the salt lost in sweat helps maintain blood volume. If large
                        amounts of water are only drunk during and after heat endurance training, dilution of body
                        fluids can occur, leading to large losses of water in the urine. This means that hydration is
                        not maintained and low sodium levels can cause heat cramps and exhaustion. To avoid this, drinks
                        must contain sodium (such as in sports drinks that contain amounts comparable to those of human
                        body fluids), or water must be drunk with food.</p>
                    <h3>WAY TO IMPROVED WELLNESS</h3>
                    <p>You have to drink water every day. Most people have been told to drink 6 to 8.8 ounce glasses of
                        water every day. That is a reasonable goal. However, different people need different amounts of
                        water to stay hydrated. Most healthy people can stay well hydrated by drinking water and other
                        liquids when thirsty. For some people, less than 8 glasses may be enough. Other people may need
                        more than 8 glasses each day. If you are concerned that you are not drinking enough water, check
                        your urine. If your urine is colorless or slightly yellow most of the time, you are well
                        hydrated. If your urine is a dark yellow or orange color, you may be dehydrated.</p>
                    Water is best for staying hydrated. Other drinks and foods can help you stay hydrated. However, some
                    can add extra calories from sugar to your diet. Fruit and vegetable juices, milk, and herbal teas
                    contribute to the amount of water you get each day. Even caffeinated drinks (e.g. coffee, tea and
                    soda) can contribute to your daily water intake. A moderate amount of caffeine (200 to 300
                    milligrams) is not harmful to most people. This is roughly the amount in 2 to 4.8 ounce cups of
                    coffee. However, it is best to limit caffeinated drinks. Caffeine can make some people urinate more
                    often, or feel anxious or jittery.</p>

                    <p>Water can also be found in fruits and vegetables (e.g. watermelon, tomatoes and lettuce) and soup
                        stock.</p>
                    <p>Sports drinks can be helpful if you plan to exercise at higher than normal levels for more than
                        an hour. It contains carbohydrates and electrolytes that can increase your energy. It helps your
                        body absorb water. However, some sports drinks are high in calories from added sugar. They can
                        also be high in sodium (salt). Check the portion size on the label. One bottle usually contains
                        more than one serving. Some sports drinks also contain caffeine. Remember that a safe amount of
                        caffeine to consume each day is between 200 and 300 mg (milligrams).</p>
                    <p>Energy drinks are not the same as sports drinks. Energy drinks usually contain large amounts of
                        caffeine. They also contain overstimulating ingredients (guarana, ginseng or taurine). These are
                        things that your body doesn't need. Most of these drinks are also high in added sugar. According
                        to doctors, children and teenagers should not drink energy drinks.</p>
                    <p>When it's hard to stay hydrated, here are some tips that can help:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Keep a bottle of water with you during the day. Bring your reusable water bottle and fill
                            it with tap water to cut your costs.
                        </li>
                        <li>- If you don't like the taste of plain water, try adding a slice of lemon or lime to your
                            drink.
                            Drink water before, during and after a workout.Drink water when you are hungry. Thirst is
                            often confused with hunger. True hunger will not be satisfied by drinking water. Drinking
                            water can also contribute to a healthy weight loss plan. Some research suggests that
                            drinking water can help you feel full.
                        </li>
                        <li>- If you have trouble remembering to drink water, drink on a schedule. For example, drink
                            water when you wake up, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and when you go to bed. Or drink a
                            small glass of water at the beginning of every hour.
                        </li>
                        <li>- Drink water when you go to a restaurant. It keeps you hydrated and it's free.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Don't wait until you notice symptoms of dehydration to take action. Actively prevent dehydration by
                    drinking plenty of water. Some people are at higher risk for dehydration, including those who
                    exercise at high intensity (or in hot weather) for too long, have certain medical conditions (kidney
                    stones, cystitis), are ill (fever, vomiting, diarrhea), are pregnant or breastfeeding , trying to
                    lose weight, or not being able to get enough fluids during the day. Older adults are also at higher
                    risk. As you get older, your brain cannot feel dehydration. It does not send signals for thirst.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Water makes up more than half of your body weight. You lose water every day when you go to the
                        bathroom, sweat and even when you breathe. You lose water even faster when it is very hot, when
                        you are physically active or when you have a fever. Vomiting and diarrhea can also lead to rapid
                        water loss. If you don't replace the water you lose, you can dry out.
