                    <p>A healthy lifestyle is one that helps maintain and improve your health and wellness. There are
                        many different things you can do to lead a healthy lifestyle, such as eating healthy, being
                        physically active, keeping your weight healthy, and dealing with your stress. A healthy
                        lifestyle is not just about healthy eating and exercise, but also about taking care of the
                        'whole you' - your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. And that means taking
                        care of you from within.
                    </p>
                    <h3>LIVING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</h3>
                    <p>While there are many common ways to live a healthy lifestyle, it actually looks different to
                        everyone and means something from person to person. Whatever you choose, a healthy lifestyle is
                        an important part of disease prevention, wellness and longevity. When you take into account your
                        diet, physical activity and stress levels, you can effectively balance all aspects of your life
                        - the "whole you." Below are 10 important things you can do to live a healthy lifestyle:
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. EAT A BALANCED DIET</h3>
                    <p>A balanced diet doesn't have to be a boring diet. As long as you're getting enough protein,
                        carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and fats, that piece of chocolate cake you fancy shouldn't be
                        doing you too much harm. Enjoy your meals, chew your food properly, and eat a variety of foods,
                        including five servings of fruits or vegetables a day. Too many processed foods or sugary foods
                        can make you feel sluggish.</p>

                    <p>Drink more water. Most of us don't drink enough water every day. Water is essential for our body
                        to function. Did you know that more than 60% of our body consists of water? Water is needed to
                        perform bodily functions, to remove waste and to transport nutrients and oxygen throughout our
                        body. Since we lose water every day through urine, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing,
                        we need to replenish our water intake. Since food intake contributes about 20% to our fluid
                        intake, which means we need to drink about 8-10 glasses a day to stay hydrated. One way to tell
                        if you are hydrated - your urine should be colorless or pale yellow. If not, you are not getting
                        enough water! Other signs are: dry lips, dry mouth, and little urination.</p>

                    <p>Eat more fruits and vegetables. Fruit contains many vitamins and minerals. As much as possible
                        you should consume your vitamins and minerals through your daily diet. Satisfy your taste buds
                        with these nutritious fruits: watermelon, apricots, avocado (yes, avocado is technically a
                        fruit!), Apple, cantaloupe, grapefruit, kiwi, guava, papaya, strawberries. Like fruits,
                        vegetables are important for good health. Experts suggest 5-9 servings of fruits / vegetables
                        per day, but unfortunately it can be difficult at times. If possible, eat foods such as kidney
                        beans, black beans, asparagus, long beans, green beans, and carrots. Think about your favorite
                        vegetables and how to include more of them in your diet every day, and choose brightly colored
                        foods. Fruits and vegetables with bright colors are good for health as they remove things in our
                        body that damage our cells. So, you get fill of fruits / vegetables of different colors: White
                        (Bananas, Mushroom), Yellow (Pineapple, Mango), Orange (Orange, Papaya), Red (Apple,
                        Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelon), Green (Guava, Avocados) , Cucumber, Lettuce, Celery),
                        Purple / Blue (blackberries, aubergine, plums).</p>

                    <h3>2. TAKE TIME TO RELAX
                    </h3>
                    <p>Relaxation is very important for a healthy mind. However you relax - deep breathing, yoga,
                        fishing, taking a bath, reading a book - try to chill for an hour a day if you can. Mental
                        exhaustion can cause stress, depression and anxiety disorders. Modern lifestyles can be hectic -
                        when you're not working, you're running after the kids or racing through the supermarket or
                        doing something else. Relax! Take a deep breath. Even fifteen minutes of this is better than
                        none, but try for an hour a day.</p>
                    <p>Deliberately breathe in deeply. Oxygen is a vital source of life. You may know how to breathe,
                        but are you breathing properly? Most of us don't breathe properly - we only breathe
                        superficially, breathing to 1/3 of our lung capacity. A full breath is one where your lungs are
                        completely filled, your abdomen expands, and there is minimal movement in your shoulders. There
                        are many benefits of deep breathing, including a reduction in stress and blood pressure,
                        strengthening of abdominal and intestinal muscles, and relief from general body aches. Deep
                        breathing also aids in better blood flow, releasing toxins from the body and helping you get a
                        better night's sleep.</p>

                    <h3>3. GET STARTED!</h3>
                    <p>There is no excuse not to exercise as there is literally something for everyone. Not everyone
                        likes to hit the treadmill or pump iron at the gym, but anything that gets your heart rate up is
                        good cardiovascular activity. How about playing tennis, meeting a friend for a swimming session
                        or self defense or martial arts? If you can't think of anything better, run up and down the
                        stairs a few times. Feeling Better Now? Exercise releases endorphins, which cheer you up.</p>
                    <p>Meditate often. Meditation calms your mind and calms your soul. It can also help you deal with
                        and cope with the stress in your life.</p>
                    <p>Exercise regularly. If you can exercise, don't do it a few times a week, but every day. Exercise
                        is the key to a healthy life. Exercising daily can improve your health in many ways. It can help
                        extend your life, lower your risk of disease, help you develop higher bone density and lose
                        weight. One simple thing you can do, especially for short distances, is to walk, drive, or
                        transport. You can climb the stairs instead of taking the elevator. You can choose exercises
                        that you can easily do at home or outside and that you enjoy. When you enjoy the physical
                        activities of your choosing, you will likely enjoy them and naturally want to do them. Exercise
                        is about being healthy and having fun at the same time. Mixing up your exercises will keep them
                        interesting.</p>

                    <h3>4. REDUCE SMOKING AND DRINKING</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever met a smoker who is glad they started smoking? Me neither. It's the most
                        destructive thing you can do to your body. Drinking can be harmful if you drink or drink too
                        much alcohol, but, like most things, moderation is key. In fact, a glass of red wine has proven
                        to be good for the heart. But too much can be devastating to your health. Smoking can
                        significantly increase the risk of lung cancer, kidney cancer, esophageal cancer, heart attack,
                        and more. Smoking "light" cigarettes also does not reduce health risks. If you smoke, quit now
                        and do it not only for yourself, but for your family and friends as well. Secondhand smoking
                        (breathing smokers' air) can cause many of the same long-term illnesses as direct smoking. There
                        is no risk-free level of secondhand smoke; even brief exposure can be harmful to your health. If
                        possible, stay away from smokers and avoid cigarette smoke whenever possible.
                    </p>


                    <h3>5. REDUCE OILY AND SUGARY FOOD, SOFT DRINKS AND CAFEINE</h3>
                    <p>If possible, reduce your intake of fast foods, French fries, donuts, chips, wedges, and fried
                        foods. Not only are they very fattening (1 tablespoon of oil is 120 calories), fried foods
                        contain acrylamide, a potential cancer-causing chemical. There are better alternatives, such as
                        grilled, steamed, stir-fried or even raw foods. Eating less sugar is also better for your
                        health. These are things like candy bars, pastries, chocolates, cookies, cakes and jelly donuts.
                        Not only do they not fill you, they make you want to eat more because of the sugar rush.
                        Instead, opt for healthy snacks such as fruits, salads, pure juices, and whole foods. Beverages
                        with caffeine are diuretics, which means that they accelerate the rate of urine production. This
                        means that they don't hydrate you as well as regular water can. Soda is also unhealthy, causes
                        weight gain, and is an artificial stimulant. Instead, replace your soda with water or vegetable
                        juices.</p>
