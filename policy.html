					    moment, the Personal Data we collect is stored on computers located in the Netherlands.
						 For the purposes of processing as described in this Privacy Statement, we may transfer

						   from the EEA or from the jurisdiction in which you live. Subject to applicable laws 
						   in such other jurisdictions, we will ensure that appropriate protections are in place
						    to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the Personal 
							Data that are equivalent to those that apply in the EEA or in the country in which you
							 live. In addition, if you use our Services while you are outside the EEA, your
							  information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with these
